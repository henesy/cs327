A straightforward dungeon generator that utilizes Dijkstra's algorithm for pathing of specific monsters and pseudo-random room and monster generation. Stairs are present which can be activated by invoking the matching symbol as the stairwell, '<' for up and '>' for down. Monsters are indexed and can be viewed by utilizing the 'm' key. Source is structured between in C++ source files and parses definitions for template-able monsters and items from the $HOME/.rlg327 directory. Colors are parsed from the file for both monsters and objects which are then represented on-screen in a fabulous, colorful, manner. Ranged attacks are initiated through the 's' command and made automatic via the 'a' command. Ranged attacks operate on range and the cardinal directions with N as the top of the screen.
